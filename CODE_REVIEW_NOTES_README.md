## Exercise 1: Code Review

### Notes

Added inline comments to provide my feedback.

### AI Usage

Code was reviewed by me, noticing critical errors, implementation bugs, naming conventions and formatting issues.
Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/) was used as well to speed up code review (though it did not spotted all issues).
