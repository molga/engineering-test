## Exercise 2: Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

### Solution

Introduced a Rule Engine to improve system flexibility and maintainability. Adhering to the SOLID principles(Open/Closed Principle, for example), this architecture uses a generic ConfigurableRule class that functions as a composite of two distinct dependencies:
- ICondition: Determines if a rule is applicable (the predicate).
- IAction: Defines the behavior or state change to apply.
The "what" was decoupled from the "when." 
New business rules can now be assembled and registered via the DI container without modifying the core codebase. 
Comprehensive unit tests have been included to verify both individual components and their integration.

## Use of Generative AI

Refactoring was completely implemented by me.

Majority (around 80%) of unit tests were generated by GitHub Copilot (free edition). After that they were reviewed by me and a few edge case scenarios were manually implemented.  

Used AI to paraphrase "Solution" section of Exercise 2.
